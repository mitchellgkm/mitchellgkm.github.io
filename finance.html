    <h2 class="blogtitle">5 Common Myths About Money You Still Believe (Part 2)</h2>
    <h4 class="blogdate">05/11/2020</h4>
    <div class="blogtext">
    <p>It's that time again, the time to bust some money myths that you might believe and that might be holding you back financially. Let's get into it&hellip;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MYTH 1 &ndash; You need a lot of money to invest</strong></p>
<p>Investing is only for the wealthy who already own thousands in stocks &ndash; investment product providers would only laugh you out of the room if you approached them with your couple hundred in birthday money.</p>
<p>Even if you did have the savings to put in the market, greedy investment companies and their brokers will surely demand huge chunks of it just for them to bash a few keyboard buttons. Any returns you could hope for would be wiped out by fees on top of fees.</p>
<p><strong>Reality &ndash; Investing is now cheaper and easier than ever</strong></p>
<p>I touched on this a bit in my last &lsquo;Money Myths&rsquo; piece in myth 4 but investing nowadays is truly <strong>cheaper and easier than ever</strong>. Minimum investment amounts are usually lower if you set up a direct debit &ndash; with some companies even offering &pound;20 monthly minimums to get started &ndash; and increase slightly if you&rsquo;re not making regular payments, but only end up around &pound;50-100 on most online platforms.</p>
<p>New cost-focused investment platforms such as Vanguard Personal Investor offer prices as low as a <em>tenth of a percent</em> of your investments each year, with additional investment fund fees starting even lower.</p>
<p>Say you invested &pound;100 a month for a year on Vanguard&rsquo;s service in a mix of their funds, averaging a <em>fifth of a percent</em> total cost. That would result in <em>total fees</em> of only <strong><u>&pound;2.40</u></strong> <strong>for the entire year</strong>!</p>
<p>If you had put that all in the FTSE 250 in 2019, you&rsquo;d have made almost &pound;300 in returns over the year &ndash; not bad for the price of less than a meal deal.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I&rsquo;ll discuss robo-advisers &ndash; the likes of Nutmeg and co &ndash; later, but I personally wouldn&rsquo;t recommend them if you&rsquo;re concerned about cost)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MYTH 2 &ndash; Saving isn&rsquo;t worth it if it isn&rsquo;t a lot</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need such a huge pile of money if you want to have a good retirement, you might as well give up now and let future you deal with it. They&rsquo;ll have more money and be more responsible. There&rsquo;s no point in putting only a few grand a year into your investments &ndash; even if your made amazing percentage returns, the actual &pound; amount you get back won&rsquo;t be much.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re better off spending everything you earn right now and just waiting until you earn a lot one day to even think about saving anything.</p>
<p><strong>Reality &ndash; Every little bit adds up</strong></p>
<p>Again, this was somewhat touched upon last time, with the myth that you&rsquo;re too young right now to think about saving, investing or &ndash; god forbid &ndash; retiring one day. As with that myth, the magic power of compound interest is your friend here. Starting early, even in small amounts, will do you wonders.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been mathematically shown that what counts most at the beginning in setting up your final savings pot is <strong><em>contributions</em>, not returns. </strong>Even in small amounts, getting a good base in</p>
<p>Pure money amounts aside, even saving / investing little bits here and there helps establish solid financial habits that will keep you on track from day one.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>MYTH 3 &ndash; Go cold turkey on spending</strong></p>
<p>Now you&rsquo;ve got those two harmful myths out the way, you better start saving hard, right? If you want to buy a house someday, have a comfortable life and enjoy a cushy retirement, you better cut your spending right down to the bone!</p>
<p>That means no more shopping, no more getting your hair done, no more going out. Starting now until the end of time, you are no longer spending any unnecessary money! Time to start saving 80% of your income and living off tins of beans for the foreseeable&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>Reality &ndash; Ease into saving habits, or they won&rsquo;t last long</strong></p>
<p>Before long, any extreme strategy like this is going to drive you mad, especially if you were extreme in your spending in the first place. Just as with any life change, easing yourself into it gives your mentality time to adjust to the new &lsquo;normal&rsquo;, making it much more likely that the change is permanent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not going to retire in poverty if you continue to enjoy the odd Starbucks or *<strong>gasp</strong>* <em>avocado toast</em> &ndash; no matter what our parents might try have us believe. The goal is to strike a healthy balance.</p>
<p>Just as you&rsquo;re harming yourself by mortgaging future happiness for its present counterpart &ndash; getting into debt, damaging your health etc. &ndash; you&rsquo;re just hurting your present self by denying them everything in return for a happier later life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MYTH 4 &ndash; Cheaper is better</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so now you have a healthy balance of saving and spending. But you want to be even savvier about it all, without going insane from lack of fun. Aha! You discover you can start making little cuts here and there by scrimping on certain things.</p>
<p>Gone are the vegan steaks. Do away with Gordon&rsquo;s, only Sainsbury&rsquo;s Basic Gin will do. You can go another few months without replacing those shoes that fill up when it rains.</p>
<p><strong>Reality &ndash; Adopt an investing mindset when buying certain things</strong></p>
<p>Here you&rsquo;re only hurting yourself in the long run by cutting corners. The old phrase of &lsquo;<em>buy cheap, buy twice</em>&rsquo; may sound like pretentious drivel spouted by pushy salespeople, but it holds weight in a lot of cases. For big purchases &ndash; shoes, computers, cars, even housing &ndash; what may seem a savvy deal at first could be a major source of headaches &ndash; and extra spending &ndash; before too long.</p>
<p>Adopt the idea that you&rsquo;re <em>investing</em> in big purchases rather than spending on them, and this will make more sense. Just as with investing your money in stocks or bonds, you want something to at least hold its value (even just to you) to justify getting involved with it in the first place.</p>
<p>Take shoes for example &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t you rather spend the extra &pound;100-200 for boots that last years, rather than needing to buy multiple replacements for the cheap pair in that same time?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MYTH 5 &ndash; Buy in bulk</strong></p>
<p>Finally! You&rsquo;ve bashed through 9 harmful myths by now and have a clear focus on <em>how to do it right</em>. You&rsquo;ve set up regular savings, cut harmful spending (but left in things that keep you happy and sane) and <em>invested</em> in some pieces that were painful to buy, but you know will serve you well for much longer.</p>
<p>The best thing to do now is to apply this new mindset to something as simple as your weekly Saino&rsquo;s run. You&rsquo;ve always heard that buying masses of everything in bulk is the best way to do it right?</p>
<p><strong>Reality &ndash; You&rsquo;re not always saving enough to make it worth it</strong></p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that buying in bulk takes advantage of factors like lower cost-per-kg and special deals/offers, the fact is that it costs more money upfront to pull off. This may not be the best option on a tight budget, where that extra chunk of cash is best served elsewhere.</p>
<p>Additionally, your food may just end up spoiling before you get a chance to eat it, which means wasting your money, contributing to food waste and defeating the purpose of buying anything in the first place. It&rsquo;s easy to justify the purchase and say you&rsquo;ll be putting that 9<sup>th</sup> can of vegetables in your food storage, but make sure you only buy what you&rsquo;ll consume.</p>

    <h2 class="blogtitle">Money Anxiety and You or, How to Cure That Sinking Feeling</h2>
    <h4 class="blogdate">05/11/2020</h4>
    <div class="blogtext">
      <p>It's hard to explain, let alone get completely rid of. That nervousness that overcomes you when you must deal with your money &ndash; if that's about what you're spending or just the concept in general. Whether it's a classic case of a heavy night out coupled with the sheepish checking of your bank balance the morning after or shying away from all mention of finances, we've all felt it to some degree, and it&rsquo;s especially common among younger people.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t to be confused with money <em>stress</em>. Money stress is a common everyday occurrence. For example, when you stress about how you are going to pay for the latest big ASOS haul, it&rsquo;s money stress. But when this stress and worry interfere with your daily life over a while, that's when it becomes money anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>The Signs to Spot</strong></p>
<p>That distinction between money stress and money anxiety is <em>crucial</em> here &ndash; the former is a universal feeling just like any other stress in life. But if you feel <em>constant</em> stress &ndash; even fear &ndash; when thinking about your finances, it&rsquo;s time to take a good hard look at it. Look out for these signs in yourself (and others!) of money anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive, constant stressing about money</strong></p>
<p>This is key &ndash; occasionally feeling stressed about finances is perfectly healthy. When it becomes a constant shadow hanging overhead, it&rsquo;s already morphed into a serious problem to be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Overspending</strong></p>
<p>Recklessness with money could be your mind&rsquo;s way of hoping to alleviate the anxiety, through good old-fashioned retail therapy. It usually ends up doing more harm than good in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Over-saving / extreme frugality</strong></p>
<p>The flipside to spending too much can be just as harmful to your long-term wellbeing. A stubborn refusal to spend money (even on essentials) or constantly worrying about getting the best deals / making your money stretch indicates a mental aversion to spending.</p>
<p><strong>Guilt</strong></p>
<p>This often lends itself to a &lsquo;vicious cycle&rsquo;. When you overspend or hoard due to some sort of fear, then chastise yourself at the same time for doing so, you often feel deep guilt. It can come with feelings of self-doubt, self-hatred and shame.</p>
<p><strong>Ignorance</strong></p>
<p>Sticking your head in the sand may feel comfortable in the moment, but it only compounds your problems going forward. This is a common anxiety-related behaviour known as <strong>avoidance</strong>. It ranges from procrastination all the way to completely refusing to learn about any aspect of your finances.</p>
<p>So now that we can spot the signs of money anxiety, how do we prevent it, and fight off those constant worries once and for all?</p>
<p><strong>Getting Rid of Money Anxiety</strong></p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve identified what to look out for when money&rsquo;s weighing on your mind, here are some steps to easing that mental burden.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pay attention to what brings up the anxiety</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Commonly known as &lsquo;triggers&rsquo;, there are certain events or experiences that can force your mental state into one of panic. This could be something related to lived trauma that initially created the money anxiety or the thought of money in and of itself.</p>
<p>As these are <em>external</em> stimuli, they are often out of your control. Rather, through identifying your triggers, you can more effectively manage your <em>internal</em> reaction to them. While this can be difficult due to that pesky avoidance mentioned earlier, understanding is the first step to healing.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Face your fears</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Typically, with anxiety, you'll do anything in your power to avoid triggers or perceived sources of further anxiety. This ends up doing more harm than good &ndash; the <em>fear of fear</em> holds you back mentally, obscuring which fears are real and which are imagined.</p>
<p>Luckily when it comes to money, you have hard facts in your corner. These are your receipts, bank statements, credit card bills. You have the <em>realities</em> readily available in cold black and white. Focus on these &ndash; though it&rsquo;s undoubtedly scarier than anything, ignoring these fears only helps to multiply them through the curse that is overthinking.</p>
<p>Separate the facts from the fictions, and you&rsquo;ll begin to have a much clearer picture of it all.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Plan, track and understand your finances</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>I am a huge proponent of budgeting and tracking your finances &ndash; I&rsquo;ve written about it quite a bit on this blog. I believe constructing a budget is the best way to face your money fears head-on and get a grip over the financial reality you&rsquo;re in.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got an understanding of where your money is going every month, you&rsquo;re in a much better position to get it all under control &ndash; and once we have that feeling of control, the dual anxieties of the <em>unknown </em>and <em>uncontrollable</em> begin to feel much more manageable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you&rsquo;re helping yourself to squash those fears, while also setting your future self up nicely with some stellar money habits.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Develop better habits</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Just like any habit worth hanging on to, financial habits don&rsquo;t come easily. You&rsquo;ll have to dedicate time (saving is one of those pesky things that requires a lot of sitting around and twiddling your thumbs), mental energy and commitment to get yourself on track and into</p>
<p>Education is a huge help here &ndash; it's all well and good telling you to get a grasp on your finances, but you need to understand them first for its importance to take root in your brain. The need for savings, how to avoid getting into too much debt, the power of compound interest &ndash; these are all crucial but barely glanced over in normal education. Luckily you can use my articles here, as well as the further resources I provide.</p>
<p>Get yourself <em>out </em>of harmful habits you might have as well. I'm mostly referring to comparing yourself to others, which is exceedingly hard these days. Once you find yourself without the need to impress people or keep up with others, a lot of worries about your financial situation ease up. Remember that we're all on our own unique, individual journeys.</p>
<p>Lastly, one of the best habits you can get into is discussing your finances with those around you. This can be painfully awkward &ndash; especially for us Brits &ndash; but once your worries are off your chest (and not just stewing alone in your mind) their burden will feel much lighter.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Talk, talk and talk some more</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This will feel very alien to most of you &ndash; money is something we <em>just don&rsquo;t talk about </em>in this country. This is especially true for our parents' generation, so try to find someone in a similar position to yourself first to confide in.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not saying you have to confess all your deepest financial secrets to your mates or go showing your banking home screen to your younger sister, What I <em>am</em> saying, however, is that even just saying your worries out loud &ndash; let alone having said person <em>help </em>with them. Is a major step in conquering them.</p>
<p><strong>3 Key Takeaways</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t confuse one-off worries for general money anxiety &ndash; nip these in the bud before they become an ongoing feeling</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learn how to spot the signs in yourself and others, and what figure out what sets off the sharpest pangs of anxiety</strong></li>
<li><strong>Not only will the recommendations here help alleviate money anxiety, but they'll also create habits that prevent it from being a problem in the future</strong></li>
</ol>
